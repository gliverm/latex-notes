%The purpose of this piece of Latex code is to convert the 
%xcolor svgnames and x11names into true RGB color definitions.  Colors
%with dvipsnames are defined in CYMK whereas svgnames
%and x11names are defined in RGB.  This nuance is taken
%into consideration.  
%
%This 'utility' was created because at the time no reliable 
%online conversion could be found.  To operate, copy
%this file into seomthing like texmaker and run XeLaTex to
%view the output.  Modify the colorname in the convertcolorspec
%line to output the color RGB values of that color name.

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

%Used to convert svgnames to RGB - do not use dvipsnames
%\selectcolormodel{rgb}
\convertcolorspec{named}{HotPink}{RGB}\tmp
RGB of the color is: \tmp   \colorbox[RGB]{\tmp}{color sample}
